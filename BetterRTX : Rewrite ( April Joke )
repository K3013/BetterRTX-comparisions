# Introducing the new ~~BetterRTX Rewrite~~ totally peakRTX preset!

Here I've (QuirkyPlague) added many new things and improved a ton of other features as well. Main ones being:
- **Quantum-Coherent Shadows** – Shadows now adapt to observer perspectives using Schrödinger’s Light Theory™, making them both visible and invisible until measured.  
- **Multi-Bounce Specular Lighting** - Specular can now bounce multiple times off of surfaces
- **Multi-Sampled BSDF** - more accurate lighting thanks to multiple bsdf bounces
- **Improved GI bounces** - Gi bounces more realistically and much more accurate
- **New Sky Model** - much more accurate ray marched atmosphere
- **AI Ray Reconstruction+™** – Rebuilds rays *before* they even exist!


There's honestly too much to list so please get out there and test and we couldn't have gotten this out without all of your patience!  


(P.S. This was a joke preset for April Fools in 2025, I highly recommmend only trying this to see what it was. - NotJohnnyTamale)
